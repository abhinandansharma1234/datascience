    "Answer1-Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two common ways of defining the probability distribution of a random variable in probability theory and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution describes how the possible values of a random variable are distributed, and the PMF and PDF are two different ways of quantifying this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF:\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It is defined as the probability that a given random variable takes on a specific value. In other words, the PMF assigns a probability to each possible value that the random variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The PMF of this random variable would assign a probability of 1/6 to each of these possible outcomes, since each outcome is equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF:\n",
    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to discrete values of a random variable, the PDF assigns probabilities to intervals of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a random variable X that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The PDF of X would describe the relative likelihood of observing X within any given interval of values. The PDF of a normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve, with higher probabilities assigned to values near the mean and lower probabilities assigned to values further from the mean.\n",

    "In summary, the PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, while the PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete random variable, the CDF is the sum of the probabilities of all the possible values of the random variable up to and including the given value. For a continuous random variable, the CDF is the integral of the PDF over the interval from negative infinity to the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a random variable X that represents the number of heads obtained when flipping two fair coins. The possible values of X are 0, 1, and 2. The CDF of X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X <= 0) = 1/4 (since the only way to get 0 heads is to get two tails)\n",
    "P(X <= 1) = 3/4 (since there are three equally likely ways to get 1 or 0 heads: HT, TH, or HH)\n",
    "P(X <= 2) = 1 (since there is only one way to get 2 heads)\n",
    "The CDF is used to answer questions about the probability of a random variable taking a value within a given range. For example, if we wanted to know the probability of getting at least one head when flipping two fair coins, we could use the CDF as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X <= 0) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n",
    "In general, the CDF is a useful tool for summarizing the entire probability distribution of a random variable in a single function, and it can be used to calculate probabilities for any range of values. It is also used to define other important quantities in probability theory, such as the median and quartiles of a distribution."
