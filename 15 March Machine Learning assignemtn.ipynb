    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence to accomplish. AI is a broad field that includes various technologies such as natural language processing, robotics, expert systems, and machine learning. One example of AI is an intelligent personal assistant such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, which can understand and respond to voice commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on that data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, the algorithms learn from the data provided to them. For example, an e-commerce company may use ML algorithms to recommend products to customers based on their previous purchases or browsing history.\n",

    "Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves training artificial neural networks to recognize complex patterns in data. DL algorithms are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain, with layers of interconnected nodes that process and interpret data. One example of DL is image recognition, where a neural network can be trained to identify objects in images, such as identifying the presence of a car in a photograph."
